# Industrial-Copper-Modeling
 This project builds machine learning models to help predict copper sales prices and whether a lead will be successful (WON) or not (LOST). It cleans and processes data, fixes issues like outliers, and uses a Streamlit app where users can enter details to get price or lead status predictions easily.
